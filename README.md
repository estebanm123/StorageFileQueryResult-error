# Windows.Storage.Search.StorageFileQueryResult Faulty State after Idle
------
This sample app is used to demonstrate a problem we are encountering where StorageFileQueryResult enters a faulty state after idle:

Repro steps:
1. Have folder with 1000+ files.
Here's a powershell script to generate 10k empty text files in the current directory.
`1..10000 | %{ "file$_.txt" | Out-File $_ -Force }`
2. Add this folder to the Pictures Library:
Right click File Explorer left-navigation bar on top of 'This PC', check show libraries', drag and drop the large folder to the Pictures library.
3. Clone this repo and launch the app with the Debug/x64 config and a debugger attached. 
4. Click the app's 'Load More StorageFiles' button until about 1000 items are queried - this can be checked in the debug console.
5. Wait for about 1-2 minutes.
6. Click 'Load More StorageFiles' again, and StorageFileQueryResult.GetFilesAsync fails to return any files. The 'Get File Count' button will also hang indefinitely in StorageFileQueryResult.GetFilesAsync.
7. It may take a couple repros to get StorageFileQueryResult into this state and after a period in this faulty state, it may start working again.
